title: Automation
description: Apply one action to many datasets or figures, or run a saved workflow.
---

When the same operation has to happen to a whole series of experiments,
automation replaces the click-per-dataset routine with one reviewed batch.

Open **File → Automation…** (also on the command palette). The window has two
tabs:

## Current Project

Works on what is already open. Search for datasets or figures and check the
ones you want — or press **Current selection** to pull in your current
selection — then pick a tool and press **Preflight** to see which targets it
will affect and which will be skipped. **Confirm and execute** applies
it, and the whole batch collapses into a single **Undo automation** step.

### Plot settings

Three tools reach the contour settings the **Object inspector** edits, so one
level, colour or line width can be applied across every 2D plot in the project
as a single reviewed batch:

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Inspect a property** | Reads the current value, the default, and the range the setting accepts |
| **Set a property** | Writes a value |
| **Reset a property** | Re-derives the value from the current data, as the panel's reset button does |

Check the plot objects you want — not the page or the dataset — then name the
setting in **Parameters (JSON)** by its id:
`{"key": "series.contour.count", "value": 12}` for **Set a property**, and
`{"key": "series.contour.count"}` for the other two.

| Setting in the Object inspector | id | Accepts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lowest level** | `series.contour.base.magnitude` | a number above 0; what it measures depends on the anchor |
| **Anchor** | `series.contour.base.policy` | `absolute`, `noise_floor`, `background_scale`, `fraction_of_range` |
| **Levels** | `series.contour.count` | 1 to 256 |
| **Level ratio** | `series.contour.ratio` | above 1, at most 10 |
| **Negative contours** | `series.contour.negative.enabled` | `true` or `false` |
| **Positive colour** | `series.contour.positive_color` | `"#rrggbb"` |
| **Negative colour** | `series.contour.negative_color` | `"#rrggbb"` |
| **Line width** | `series.contour.line_width` | 0.05 to 10 |

[Contour levels](/guides/contour-levels/) explains what each setting does and
which data each anchor needs.

One plot can hold several series, so these tools work per series: preflight and
the result list show a row for each, naming the plot object and the series
inside it. A series the setting does not reach — a heatmap drawn under a
contour — is listed as **Skipped** with the reason, and the remaining series are
still applied. An object with nothing to address, such as a text box, is skipped
the same way.

A value outside the range is refused at **Preflight**, before you confirm, and
names both the value you gave and the limit that rejected it. Past that point
either every listed series takes the value or none does, and what is written
collapses into one **Undo automation** step.

**Inspect a property** returns its readings to whoever ran it: run it as a
workflow step and the values land in the run record, which is also what
[the command line](/reference/cli/) writes to its manifest file. In the window
the numbers appear under **Result value (JSON)**, below the per-series rows:
one reading per series, each with its current value, its default and the range
it accepts.

## External Inputs

Runs a saved workflow that starts from files on disk — for example: import
every experiment in a folder, apply a processing recipe, and export each
figure. Press **Open workflow…** to load it, **Validate** to check it, then
**Confirm and run workflow**. Progress is reported step by step and a long run
can be cancelled.

## What is recorded

A workflow run leaves a record of the workflow and its hash, the PlotX version,
and every step's targets, parameters and results. Run it here and that record is
kept in the project; run it from [the command line](/reference/cli/) and the
same record is written to a file. A batch from **Current Project** leaves no
such record — it is an ordinary edit, in the document and on the undo stack.

Anything that writes files outside the project — exporting figures, for
instance — is also listed under **Help → Operation and Diagnostic History**,
with each file's path, size and SHA-256 checksum. An export that fails partway
still names the files it had already written, so nothing reaches disk
unaccounted for.

Workflow files are plain JSON and can also be run without the desktop app —
see [the command line](/reference/cli/), which executes the same workflows
headlessly. [File formats](/reference/file-formats/) describes the workflow
and run-record files themselves.
